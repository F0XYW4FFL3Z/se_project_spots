**Description**

This is Spots. A Software Engineering project based on media sharing websites. This was made for the Sprint 3, Sprint 4, and Sprint 5's project on TripleTen. I spent roughly two days on the whole project and it allowed me to learn the ins and outs of adaptive web design and media queries in CSS.
